# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `Bug.java` file contains code that causes this exception. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.

The error arises from an incorrect loop condition in accessing an array. The solution modifies this condition to prevent the exception.

This example is useful for understanding how to correctly iterate over arrays in Java and avoid common off-by-one errors.
